# 🚀 NetWOL – Wake on LAN Utility

---

## 📖 Story Behind the Project

We built **NetWOL** out of the need for a **simple, fast, and reliable** way to remotely power on computers.
As developers, gamers, and system administrators, we often leave machines at home or in the office that we want to wake up remotely.

Most existing WOL tools are either:

* bloated with ads,
* too complicated for beginners,
* or don’t support modern setups.

So we created **NetWOL** – a lightweight Wake-on-LAN utility that **just works**.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Enable **Wake-on-LAN (WOL)** in your PC’s **BIOS/UEFI** and operating system.
2. Connect your machine via **Ethernet** (Wi-Fi usually doesn’t support WOL).
3. Add your device in NetWOL using its **MAC address** and **IP address**.
4. Tap **Wake** in the app.

👉 A **Magic Packet** is sent to your network interface card (NIC).
👉 Your PC/server wakes up instantly.

That’s it. No hassle.
